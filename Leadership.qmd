### **Pandemic Response: Ventilator Deployment (2020)**  

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I led a team of engineers to coordinate, train, and oversee the installation of approximately 300 mechanical ventilators across hospitals in multiple regions of Colombia. As the project lead, I managed planning, resource allocation, and on-site execution, ensuring that life-saving equipment reached medical teams quickly and effectively .

### Community Health Brigades and Social Support  

In my hometown, I actively participated in community service through my school, a local convent-run institution. Working with classmates and mentors, we organized health brigades, food and household supply drives, and visits to vulnerable families, delivering essential resources to those most in need.
