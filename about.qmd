Welcome to my portfolio website, a space where I share a little about myself and my background in technology, business, and healthcare.
I am an MBA student at University Canada West in Canada, originally from Colombia. My academic background combines a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Biomedical Engineering with a postgraduate specialization in Marketing, creating a strong foundation in both technology and business.

After graduating, I participated in a cultural exchange program in the United States, an experience that enhanced my adaptability, independence, and communication skills. I then worked in Colombian clinics as a Biomedical Engineer, followed by over four years as a biomedical product engineer in the southwestern region of Colombia, specializing in commercial operations for advanced medical equipment.

Currently, while pursuing my MBA, I am further strengthening my skills in:

- **Leadership**
- **Business Strategy**
- **Data Analysis**
- **Applied Data Science**

I am passionate about continuously learning, turning innovative ideas into action, and leading diverse teams with purpose. My goal is to integrate technology, marketing, and analytics to address real-world challenges in the technology and healthcare industries.
